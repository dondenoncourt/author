And that’s it. At this point, you can start writing your app like you’ve always done. To run it, you just need to type `rake start` and both React and Rails will start. Sweet, just one terminal window!

To deploy your app, you just need to git add ., git commit -m and then issue git push heroku master. Don’t forget to seed your database with heroku run rake db:seed!

to start
`rake start`

This post covers how to use the memory palace technique to memorize technical books.

https://www.infoq.com/articles/relearning-learn/
Reading and understanding isn't enough, you need to be able to remember what you read.
Do active reading -- where your brain takes part elaborating on the concept and making it your own.
Slow down, take creative notes, and know that whereas rereading doesn’t work, quizzing does.
Always reflect on what you just read and apply it to your imagined or real context.
Take control of your learning queue and your offline storage (such as bookmarks, Evernote, and wikis.)

Retiring Mainframe Programmers: Should I Care?
This was a piece commissioned by InfoQ. It did extremely well with tons of comments and discussions.
Key Takeaways:
Mainframe developers are not just retiring, they are expiring -- and young developers have little interest in mainframe careers.
Mainframe programmers have be treated like bus drivers whose only job is to consistently move huge amounts of data.
It’s not the mainframes that are aging; mainframes out compete Microsoft and Linux on features like performance, scalability, security, and reliability.
Refactor code into reusable modules, with tests, and adopt agile practices.
There is no ROI for modernizing mainframe applications in terms of quarterly results.

In this piece I will speak from my experience and heart on the subject of hiring and getting hired. I’m writing for two audiences: Oldies looking for work and Youngies doing the hiring.

Key Takeaways:
There are lots of misconceptions around hiring older programmers.
Older coders can bring a wide range of experience and different viewpoints to a team.
Adding older coders can contribute to team diversity and better outcomes.
When applying for a role as an older coder emphaze your ability to learn and recent relevant experience
It's important to be a lifelong learner, no matter what your age.

Show Up for Work and Don't StealShow Up for Work and Don't Steal
This article really is about how I think a coder should "show up for
work." It has some fun with a story about one of my sons, who is now a
successful Investment Banker and a VP at harriswilliams.com
